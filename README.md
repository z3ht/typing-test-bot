# typing-test-bot
A bot made for TypeRacer at play.typeracer.com/

Setting this bot up is very simple, but instructions must be followed carefully.

Either create a file called "Typing Test Text.txt" or double click your Typing Test.jar file
In that typing test, simply copy and paste the text you would like it to type

This is a little tricky on Type Racer, you gotta scroll over the text, click inspect element and open the <span> tag
Copy and paste all of those words. It will give you all but the first word.
You have to type that one and dont click space or add punctuation.

Once you have saved the text file, simply double click the jar file.
You will have exactly one second to scroll your mouse over to the type racers text box.
Once the one second is up, the bot will start typing the code as if you are a super fast human.

Enjoy getting on the leaderboard!!
