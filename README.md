# typing-test-bot
A bot made for TypeRacer at play.typeracer.com/

Setting this bot up is very simple, but instructions must be followed carefully.

Either create a file called "Typing Test Text.txt" in the same folder ad your jar file or double click your Typing Test.jar file
In the newly created text file, simply copy and paste the text you would like it to type

This is a little tricky on Type Racer, but I'll tell you how...
You gotta scroll over the text block you see after joining a race, click inspect element and open the highlighted <span> tag
Copy and paste all of those words. It will give you all but the first word.
You have to type that one in manually.
  Note: Do not add any punctuation or spaces to the manually typed word

Once you have saved the text file with text inside, simply double click the jar file.
You will have exactly one second to scroll your mouse over to the type racers text box.
Once the one second is up, the bot will start typing the code as if you are a super fast human.

Enjoy getting on the leaderboard!!
